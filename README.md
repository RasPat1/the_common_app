# The Common App
---
The Common App removes the tedium of applying to all the jobs.  Put your info in once and just hit a button.
Install chromedriver

Check out this question on [Quora](https://www.quora.com/Why-is-there-no-common-application-for-job-applications-like-there-is-for-college-applications). The answers are incredibly bad actually. So we've logically concluded with total certainty that the only reason that this has not been done yet is that no one thinks there is any money in it. Oddly I've found a few other forums that have this question asked and answered. There all terrible answers

Possible Product flows:
1) Install the chrome extension.  Start applying to jobs. Presumably, you're looking for jobs and are going to apply to some. As you apply we'll pick up the info that you're putting down and use that to compile your information. The more jobs you apply to the more info we'll store and the more jobs we can automatically apply for.

2) Go to the website and create an account. Answer some simple generic questions. Upload your resume.  Select all organizations you want to apply to and any place where you definitely don't want us to send an application.  We'll show you "high priority generic questions". If you answer these more specific but still widely used question (biggest challenge, your superpower, questinos liek this) then we can apply to many more companies. We'll prioritize which questions you'll answer so that you can get the best return on your time. Then select any specific comapnies where you're interesetd. You can write specifc answers for those.  It's more or less the same system as the common app.
